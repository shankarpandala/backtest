# ml4t-backtest: Known Limitations and Assumptions

This document describes the known limitations, assumptions, and edge cases in ml4t-backtest.
Understanding these helps set realistic expectations for backtest results.

## Settlement and Clearing

### T+0 Settlement (Default)
- **Assumption**: All trades settle immediately (T+0)
- **Reality**: US equities settle T+2, futures T+1
- **Impact**: Buying power is available immediately after a sale
- **Workaround**: Use `settlement_delay=2` in BacktestConfig for T+2 settlement, or `cash_buffer_pct` to reserve liquidity

### Settlement Delay (Optional)
- `settlement_delay` models T+N settlement (proceeds unavailable for N bars)
- Does not model partial settlement or settlement failure

## Corporate Actions

### Pre-Adjusted Data Assumed
- **Assumption**: Input data is already split/dividend adjusted
- Backtesting with unadjusted data will produce incorrect results
- Recommendation: Use adjusted close prices from data providers

### No Automatic Liquidation on Delisting
- Delisted securities are not automatically closed
- Positions persist until explicit exit signal or end of data
- Manual handling required for bankruptcy/delisting scenarios

### Dividends and Interest
- Dividend payments are not modeled (assumed reinvested in price)
- Short selling borrowing costs are not modeled
- Bond coupon payments are not supported

## Execution Model

### SAME_BAR Mode (Look-Ahead Bias Risk)
- Orders filled at the same bar's close introduce look-ahead bias
- Use `NEXT_BAR` mode for realistic execution
- SAME_BAR mode useful for vectorized strategy comparison only

### NEXT_BAR Mode Edge Cases
1. **Deferred Exit Re-Entry**: When a stop-loss triggers and defers to next bar's open,
   entry signals on the same bar are blocked to prevent same-bar re-entry.
   This matches VectorBT Pro behavior.

2. **Order Queue Priority**: Exits are processed before entries each bar to ensure
   capital freed by exits is available for new entries.

### No Intrabar Order Priority
- Within a single bar, order execution sequence is:
  1. Deferred exits from previous bar (at open)
  2. Risk rule exits (stop-loss, take-profit)
  3. Strategy entry orders
- Cannot model specific intrabar order sequences

### Gap Handling
- Gap opens are handled: if bar opens beyond stop price, fill at open
- This models slippage during fast market conditions
- Large gaps may fill at worse prices than the stop level

## Market Impact

### Fixed Slippage Model (Default)
- Default slippage is percentage-based, not volume-dependent
- Does not account for order book depth or market impact
- Large orders in illiquid securities may face higher slippage

### Volume Limits (Optional)
- `ExecutionLimits` can constrain fills to percentage of bar volume
- Requires volume data in the feed
- Partial fills create multi-bar execution

### No Order Book Modeling
- All orders assume sufficient liquidity at quoted prices
- Limit orders fill if price is touched (no queue position)
- Market orders fill at close/open (no spread modeling)

## Short Selling

### Unlimited Borrowing Assumed
- No locate requirements or borrow availability checks
- Any security can be shorted without constraint
- No hard-to-borrow fees or rebate rates

### Margin Calls
- Margin accounts enforce maintenance margin requirements
- Position liquidation on margin call is not automatic
- Strategies should monitor margin via `get_buying_power()`

### Uptick Rule
- No uptick rule (Rule 201) enforcement
- Short sales allowed at any price level

## Risk Management

### Position-Level vs Portfolio-Level
- Position rules (StopLoss, TakeProfit, etc.) operate independently per position
- Portfolio rules (MaxDrawdown, MaxPositions) check aggregate exposure
- Cross-position hedging is not automatically recognized

### Stop Order Fill Modes
- `STOP_PRICE`: Fill at exact stop price (default)
- `BAR_EXTREME`: Fill at bar's low/high (conservative)
- `NEXT_BAR_OPEN`: Defer to next bar's open (Zipline-style)
- `CLOSE_PRICE`: Fill at bar's close (VectorBT Pro-style)

### Trailing Stop Initialization
- New positions use close price as initial high-water mark
- Entry bar's high is NOT used (matches VectorBT Pro)
- High-water mark updates begin on the bar after entry

## Data Requirements

### OHLCV Data Expected
- Full OHLCV bars provide most accurate execution simulation
- Close-only data limits stop/limit order accuracy
- Volume data required for `ExecutionLimits`

### No Tick Data Support
- Bar-based execution only
- Tick-by-tick order book simulation not available
- Use smaller bar intervals for higher precision

### Timezone Handling
- Naive datetimes default to UTC
- Calendar sessions use exchange timezone
- Mixed timezones may cause unexpected behavior

## Calendar and Sessions

### Trading Calendar (Optional)
- Exchange calendars enforce trading hours
- `enforce_sessions=True` skips bars outside sessions
- Overnight gaps handled when calendar is enabled

### CME/Futures Overnight Sessions
- Overnight sessions (e.g., CME equity futures) are supported
- Set `overnight=True` for calendar types that trade overnight
- Session boundaries respect next-day roll

## Numerical Precision

### Fractional Shares
- Fractional quantities supported by default
- Set `share_type=INTEGER` for whole shares only
- Very small positions may cause rounding issues

### Price Precision
- All prices stored as Python floats (IEEE 754 double)
- May introduce minor floating-point errors
- Not suitable for sub-penny precision requirements

## What's NOT Modeled

The following real-world factors are **not** simulated:

1. **Broker API latency** - Orders execute instantly
2. **Quote stuffing / HFT interference** - Clean price discovery assumed
3. **Exchange halts / circuit breakers** - All bars are tradeable
4. **Order cancellation delays** - Cancels are instant
5. **Partial fills due to queue position** - Limit orders fill completely or not at all
6. **Regulatory restrictions** - PDT, accredited investor, etc.
7. **Tax implications** - No wash sale tracking
8. **Currency conversion** - Single currency assumed

## Validation Status

### Scenario-Level Validation (16 scenarios x 4 frameworks)

| Framework | Scenarios | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| VectorBT Pro | 16/16 | PASS (exact match) |
| VectorBT OSS | 16/16 | PASS (exact match) |
| Backtrader | 16/16 | PASS (exact match) |
| Zipline | 15/15 | PASS (exact match) |

Scenarios cover: long-only, long/short, stop-loss, take-profit, commission models,
slippage models, trailing stops, bracket orders, short selling, rule combinations,
and 1500-bar stress tests across 9 market regimes.

### Large-Scale Parity (250 assets x 20 years, real data)

| Profile | Trades | Gap | Value Gap |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|
| zipline_strict | 225,583 | 0 trades (0.00%) | $19 (0.0001%) |
| backtrader_strict | 216,980 | 1 trade (0.0005%) | $503 (0.004%) |
| vectorbt_strict | 210,352 | 91 trades (0.04%) | $0 (0.00%) |
| lean | 428,459 fills | 0 fills (0.00%) | $1.55 (0.0002%) |

### What's Validated

**Core Execution** (210k+ trades per profile on real data):
- Entry/exit timing and fill prices (open, close, stop price)
- Position tracking (long and short)
- P&L calculations and multi-asset portfolio management
- Cash constraints, margin, and buying power

**Risk Rules** (16 scenario tests per framework):
- Stop-loss and take-profit (long and short)
- Trailing stop with close-based HWM (long and short)
- Bracket orders (SL + TP)
- Rule combinations (TSL+TP, TSL+SL, TSL+TP+SL)
- 1500-bar stress test across 9 market regimes with gap events

### Remaining Gaps

- LEAN parity gap (+589 trades) under investigation (buying power reservation model)
- Per-share commission and volume-based slippage not cross-validated
- VWAP and MID execution prices not cross-validated

## Recommendations

### For Realistic Backtests
1. Use `NEXT_BAR` execution mode
2. Set `slippage_rate` >= 0.001 (0.1%)
3. Set `commission_rate` >= 0.001 (0.1%)
4. Enable `reject_on_insufficient_cash`
5. Use exchange calendar for accurate session handling

### For Strategy Comparison
1. Use `SAME_BAR` mode for vectorized comparison with VectorBT
2. Use identical settings across all frameworks
3. Focus on relative performance, not absolute returns

### For Production Readiness
1. Validate with `BacktestConfig.from_preset("realistic")`
2. Run with historical crisis periods (2008, 2020, 2022)
3. Test with varied slippage and commission assumptions
4. Paper trade before live deployment
